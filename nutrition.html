            <h2>Macronutrients</h2>
            <p>
              Macronutrients are the main nutrient sources we need in larger amounts, which provides the energy our body needs. These are consumed from carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Micronutrients are mostly vitamins and minerals, and are equally important but consumed in very small amounts. We generally get our micronutrients along with macronutrients. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The typical adult female will need 2000kcal per day, whereas the typical adult male will need 2500kcal. Of these 2000/2500 calories we need to consume daily, typically, 50% are needed from carbs, 30% are needed from protein and the final 20% needed are fats. Together, in this ratio, they combine to provide our body with all the energy it will need.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, these are only rough estimates. For instance, a male adult in his 20s working in construction and going gym 5 days a week will more than likely require more than 2500kcal. To achieve your fitness goals, it is essential to know the exact macronutrients you need and in what ratio.

                <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
                <p>
                Carbohydrates are sugar molecules. The three main types of carbs are starches, fiber and sugars. Your body breaks down these carbs into glucose. Glucose is your body's main source of energy, it's vital for your cells, tissues and organs. It can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use, but any unused glucose stored in your body which is not used, will end up being converted and stored in your body as fat instead.

                <h2>Protein</h2>
                <p>
                Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. These amino acids are essential for repairing and building muscle fibers after they have been damaged by workouts. Protein is also used as an energy source, but almost always used as anaerobic fuel, which is commonly used in weight training.
                </p> 
                <p>
                However, protein isn't just needed for weigh training. Haemoglobin, which is a type of protein found in red blood cells, carries oxygen all around the body. They are also found in bone, hair, skin, and virtually every other body part or tissue.
                </p> 
                <p>
                There are at least 10,000 different proteins that make you what you are and keep you that way.
                </p> 
                <p class="font-italic">
                It is recommended that you consume 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day.

                <h2>Fats</h2>
                <p>
                Fats are a source of essential fatty acids, which the body cannot make itself. Fat helps the body absorb vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E. These vitamins are fat-soluble, which means they can only be absorbed with the help of fats, but it's important to consume healthy fats where possible.
