            <h2>Macronutrients</h2>
            <p>
              Macronutrients are the main nutrient sources we need in larger amounts, which provides the energy our body needs. These are consumed from carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Micronutrients are mostly vitamins and minerals, and are equally important but consumed in very small amounts. We generally get our micronutrients along with macronutrients. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The typical adult female will need 2000kcal per day, whereas the typical adult male will need 2500kcal. Of these 2000/2500 calories we need to consume daily, typically, 50% are needed from carbs, 30% are needed from protein and the final 20% needed are fats. Together, in this ratio, they combine to provide our body with all the energy it will need.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, these are only rough estimates. For instance, a male adult in his 20s working in construction and going gym 5 days a week will more than likely require more than 2500kcal. To achieve your fitness goals, it is essential to know the exact macronutrients you need and in what ratio.

                <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
                <p>
                Carbohydrates are sugar molecules. The three main types of carbs are starches, fiber and sugars. Your body breaks down these carbs into glucose. Glucose is your body's main source of energy, it's vital for your cells, tissues and organs. It can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use, but any unused glucose stored in your body which is not used, will end up being converted and stored in your body as fat instead.
