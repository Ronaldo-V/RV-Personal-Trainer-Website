# TESTING

## Responsiveness test
All pages and the content within them have been designed with a mobile-first approach and made to be fully responsive on all devices.

- The website should shrink/expand accordingly with the layout changing ever so slightly depending on the device screen width.
- All links should work regardless of the device being used.
- All Content must be readable.
- Images should maintain its quality regardless of screen size.
- The form should be able to be filled out no matter what device is being used.

Tests have been done through the use of DevTools on the browser.

| Device screen width | Extra Small <576px | Small ≥576px | Medium ≥768px | Large ≥992px | Extra Large ≥1200px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Header / Navigation Responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Good | Good |
| All Images Responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Good | Good |
| All Text Responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Good | Good |
| Form Responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Good | Good |
| Footer Responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Good | Good |

I Have tested every device available in which the DevTools allow. Below are screenshots of some devices tested on.
