                    Amazing PT! Workout and diet plans are so clear and easy to follow. Ronaldo is very professional; the workouts were challenging but enjoyable, and he really helped me get my weight under control. Hands down the best PT I have ever trained with.

                <h4 >Client 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Having medical conditions and general disengagement with exercise, I decided to join a gym and get a Personal Trainer. Fast forward 4 months and I feel like a whole new person. Ronaldo has really empowered and influenced my lifestyle so much so that not only did my posture and physical shape improve, but so did my mental wellbeing.

                <p>
                    It would not be an exaggeration to say that Ronaldo has been instrumental in my health journey. Tailored workout plans which emphasised what I was good at but also tackling my weaknesses, as well as nutritional advice has really helped me become a healthier me. I have been training with Ronaldo for just under a year now and have lost 18.7kg!!! I still have more to lose for my target, but I could have never imagined such a big change. Thank you Ronaldo, I am truly grateful.

                <p>
                    Ronaldo is a very friendly, patient and professional trainer. He gives great advice. Personally, I tend to stick to what I know and enjoy, I rarely try new things at the gym, however, Ronaldo introduced me to weight training and I must say, I never thought I would see myself ever doing deadlits, but Ronaldo encouraged me to try and he also pushed me when I doubted myself.
